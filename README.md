- `dim_customer`:
  - Markets: 27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
  - Customers: 75 distinct entities across markets
  - Platforms: Brick & Mortar (Physical stores), E-commerce (Online stores like Amazon, Flipkart)
  - Channels: Retailer, Direct, Distributors

- `dim_market`:
  - Markets: 27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
  - Sub-zones: 7 sub-zones
  - Regions: APAC, EU, LATAM, and others

- `dim_product`:
  - Divisions: P&A (Peripherals & Accessories), PC (Personal Computers), N&S (Networking & Storage)
  - Categories: 14 different categories, including Internal HDD, Keyboards, etc.
  - Variants: Multiple variants available for each product type

### Fact Tables

These tables contain dynamic data regarding transactions and forecasts.

- `fact_forecast_monthly`:
  - Purpose: To anticipate customer demand, enhancing satisfaction and reducing storage costs
  - Structure: Denormalized for analytical efficiency, with dates standardized to the month's start
  - Contents: Includes all necessary columns, ending with the forecast quantity needed by the customer

- `fact_sales_monthly`:
  - Similar to `fact_forecast_monthly` but concludes with the actual quantity sold rather than the forecast

This thorough dataset serves as the backbone for the analysis performed in this project.

## Data Model

Data modeling is the bedrock upon which our entire reporting structure is built. It is the framework that dictates how data is connected, processed, and presented in the form of visuals.
